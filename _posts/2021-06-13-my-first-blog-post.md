I am looking to pursue a career in data analytics, using the strategies and tools of business intelligence. Also, I am interested in learning data science, so I am also looking to expand my knowledge in different languages and ML. I am very good at geography, I am able to know where pretty much every country is on a map, and I know every which way one would get from one place to another in a certain area. In other words, I'm skilled at navigation. I am also a member of NHS, and I have received an award for this recently.
